ma is eating alone at the table in the breakfast nook, 
some crackers 
and her usual morning coffee. instant. 
the kind you get from a big glass jar and mix w/ water and maybe some milk. 
they are watching their cholesterol now so skim milk it is. 
the coffee looks a lot darker and thinner than it used to. 
she dips the cracker in the coffee to soften it and sometimes forget 
how long it's been in there while she reads the paper. 
i see some big headlines ab some celebrity's award season outfits. 
this is saturday morning. 
         and every morning."</h2>
