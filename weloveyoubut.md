> my parents came to visit me in LA for the first time since i moved a few months ago. it actually went really well. we ate, walked around, had a great time. then my mom called me yesterday and said that she felt my life was sad.

mom

mom is eating alone at the table in the breakfast nook, </br>
some crackers </br>
> and her usual morning coffee. instant. </br>
the kind you get from a big glass jar and mix w/ water and maybe some milk. 
they are watching their cholesterol now so skim milk it is. 
the coffee looks a lot darker and thinner than it used to. 
she dips the cracker in the coffee to soften it and sometimes forget 
how long it's been in there while she reads the paper. 
i see some big headlines ab some celebrity's award season outfits. 
this is saturday morning. 
and every morning.


> her favorite snack is 绿豆糕 . anything sweet and cakey really. can't get enough of the stuff. just one more piece. 

> i still get embarrassed by the way she eats. grandma used to tell me that i ate like her, w/ my mouth closed, like a lady. after working in the kitchens for such a long time where there was barely any time for breaks, mom scarfs food down, but her mouth is still closed, so her cheeks bulks up and she just keeps shoveling food in until she can't anymore. because she always thinks she's running out of time. or maybe because she doesn't want to say anything. or maybe she feels she has nothing to say. 

> mom are you lonely? do you get bored being by yourself all the time? "no i love it. i really love it. so enjoyable."

> hey i just wanted to call and explain. your mom doesn't care about your hair being long or short. it's just that... after meeting your friends... she felt maybe that... you were coming out as lesbian.
