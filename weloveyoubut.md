#### mornings ####
ma is eating alone at the table in the breakfast nook,  
some crackers  
and her usual morning coffee. instant.  
the kind you get from a big glass jar and mix w/ water  
and maybe some milk.  
they are watching their cholesterol now so skim milk it is.  
the coffee looks a lot darker and thinner than it used to.  
she dips the cracker in the coffee to soften it and sometimes  
forget how long it's been in there while she reads the paper.  
i see some big headlines ab some celebrity's award season outfits.  
this is saturday morning.  
and every morning.  


#### like a lady ####
i still get embarrassed by the way she eats.  
grandma used to tell me that i ate like her,  
w/ my mouth closed, like a lady.  
after working in the kitchens for such a long time  
where there was barely any time for breaks,  
ma scarfs food down, but her mouth is still closed,  
so her cheeks bulks up and she  
just keeps shoveling food in until she can't anymore.   
because she always thinks she's running out of time.  
or maybe because she doesn't want to say anything.  
or maybe she feels she has nothing to say.  


#### always in chorus ####
ma is sewing and putting the finishing touches  
on a dress i was wearing for that year's musical.  
was it "hello, dolly!"?  
who can remember something from half a lifetime ago.  
she calls me over to try it on.   
"why you do the musicals?"  
"because they are fun and my friends are all in it."  
"but you not good at it. always in chorus."  


#### are you? ####
hey daughter,  
i just wanted to call and explain.  
your mom doesn't care  
about your hair being long or short. it's just that...   
after meeting your friends...   
she felt that...   
maybe...  
you were coming out.
