during my annual visit home to see my extended family, i take a daily walk with my grandma in a nearby park. she's almost 88, a year older than my grandpa when he passed away in 2007. she hasn't been able to hear much after grandpa passed away, some say it was caused by grief. other than that, she's in great health and doesn't have much to worry ab other than a hardened callus on her foot.

on our walks, she likes to talk about anything from what she had for breakfast to stories from the past. when you are at that age, you spend every day mainly focused on meals and memories. as she's gotten older, i've noticed that she's also become a lot more open about sharing her thoughts and feelings, often screaming them, thinking everyone else around her is also hard of hearing. 

i'd heard a rumor a long time ago and wanted to use our walk to hear it from the source.

my grandpa, born in 1920, was 10 years older than my grandma. when they married, granpda was already 28, quite old by the standards of the time. so i asked, "grandma, grandpa was quite a bit older than you. did he have any relationships before you two were together?"

"yes, he did." she answered so quickly that i wasn't ready with a follow up question.

"umm, did you know who it was? was it serious?" i asked sheepishly. maybe i was prying into something that didn't need to be disturbed.

"yea they wanted to get married, but the party secretary wouldn't approve of it because she was japanese."

MIND. BLOWN.


there was a music teacher in the revolution (my grandparents were both in the troop but the morale boosting / propaganda part ha... my grandpa was the head of that unit, responsible for mega productions of plays, musicals and choral numbers. conducted and composed music etc... badass shit) the teacher was japanese

 they wanted to get married but the powers above said no way
 at that time you follow everything
so the teacher actually told my grandma that my grandpa was a great man
everyone knew him since he was the boss
 i was like umm grandma didn't you worry ab leftover feelings
 she goes... that i can understand.. she was a good person and it wasn't like they did anything wrong. feelings were genuine and nothing you can do
 i was floored
 so i said to her that i'm afraid that i'm always gonna have leftover feelings for people
 and she goes... that's ok
 apparently later on that woman was in town and they had lunch w her
haha my grandma later on when grandpa was sick in the end goes... if you ended up w her, would she take care of you like this? haha i go, grandma come one she would have... she goes, no, i don't think so hahaha
