### road not taken ###
stories about people at a crossroad and the path chosen for them


#### komatsu ####

during my annual visit home to see my extended family, i take a daily walk with my grandma in a nearby park. she's almost 88, a year older than my grandpa when he passed away in 2007. she hasn't been able to hear much after grandpa passed away, some say it was caused by grief. other than that, she's in great health and doesn't have much to worry ab other than a hardened callus on her foot.

on our walks, she likes to talk about anything from what she had for breakfast to stories from the past. when you are at that age, you spend every day mainly focused on meals and memories. as she's gotten older, i've noticed that she's also become a lot more open about sharing her thoughts and feelings, often screaming them, thinking everyone else around her is also hard of hearing.

my grandparents were married for 58 years. they used to write poems to each other into their 50s and 60s. my grandma has written a letter a to my grandpa every time she visitsi'd heard a rumor a long time ago and wanted to use our walk to hear it from the source.

my grandpa, born in 1920, was 10 years older than my grandma. when they married, granpda was already 28, quite old by the standards of the time. so i asked, "grandma, grandpa was quite a bit older than you. did he have any relationships before you two were together?"

"yes, he did." she answered so quickly that i wasn't ready with a follow up question.

"umm, did you know who it was? was it serious?" i asked sheepishly. maybe i was prying into something that didn't need to be disturbed.

"yea they wanted to get married, but the party secretary wouldn't approve of it because she was japanese."

without me asking, grandma continued...

"she was a music teacher in our troupe during the revolution. xiaosong 小松 was her name (i was curious and looked up the japanese original: komatus). our unit was responsible for boosting morale, putting on plays, musicals and choral numbers. your grandpa was the head of that unit (he was completely self taught, not only directing but composing and conducting composing original works... a total badass.)

"she wasn't very tall or great looking compared to some of the other girls, but she was a genuine person and they were serious. after they were told no, they separated, and it was actually komatsu who told me to pursue things with your grandpa. she told me that he was a great and kind man."

"grandma, did you worry about any leftover feelings they might've had?"

"that i can understand. she was a good person and they didn't do anything wrong. feelings were genuine and there's nothing you can do about that. later on, we would have lunch together when she was in town. this is all before she went back to japan."

"your grandpa and i had a great life together. i did everything i could to care for him and our family. he respected me and never laid a finger on me. that's what i asked for when we got married, to be treated with respect, if not an equal. 

when he was sick in the end, i said to him, if you ended up with komatsu, would she have taken care of you like this?"

"and he said: 'i don't think so'."

as we walked around the park, i kept thinking about komatsu. why was she in china? when did she go? did she arrive during the second sino-japanese war? why did she join the fight against KMT on the communist side? and where did she go?

at the end of my trip on my way to the airport, i sat in the car, still thinking about this story. i sheepishly asked two of my uncles if they knew about this story, not wanting to be the one to break the story and the silence. 

"oh yea, what was her name again? xiaosong (komatsu), that's right. they saw her later on as well, before she went back to japan. i'm not sure how true this is, but apparently she was raped by one of the higher ups. maybe that's why she left."

for a family that's not big on feelings, this was a lot of sharing. 

as i grew more curious, i started thinking about others like her. who were these women? 

a cursory google search only surfaced two relevant articles--one was about a recent commemoration of japanese soldiers (some POWs) who stayed in china after the second sino-japanese war and fought against the KMT, and the other, about japanese women who returned to japan and the only question asked of them by their countrymen: whether they were raped by the chinese.
