## Chapter 4 
### Probability Distributions

We examine core concepts from probability through examples from several important probability distributions: the Gaussian (normal) distribution, Bernoulli distribution, binomial, Poisson, geometric, and exponential. We briefly discuss the chi-squared, T, and F distributions, which will be revisited later in Chapter 6 (Introduction to Hypothesis Testing). These ideas are important for understanding linear and logistic regression models, other probabilistic models, and most hypothesis tests.
