## Chapter 11 
### Survival Data and the Kaplan-Meier Curve

This chapter is our entrypoint into time-to-event data and survival models. We talk about the concept of censoring and its effect on models. We learn about the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier estimator and spend the bulk of the chapter constructing Kaplan-Meier curves by hand for an ovarian cancer dataset. Key terms: survival, hazard, censoring, Kaplan-Meier estimator. (; 8 pages)
