### A Brief Note on Feature Engineering

This short chapter takes a closer look at features and the role of the data scientist in choosing appropriate features for a problem. We talk about how to code different classes of features (numbers, binary yes/no, categories) and briefly touch on how transformations can be used to adjust features. We look back at the features used in Chapters 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 and how they were coded. (; 5 pages)
