## Chapter 7 
### Building a Decision Tree

This chapter focuses on the conceptual and algorithmic details behind decision trees. We look at how tree building algorithms choose features based on measures of impurity/uncertainty, such as entropy or the Gini coefficient. We examine a decision tree built on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset and build a tree of our own from scratch using the ID3 algorithm on a small (10-sample) dataset. Following on our discussion in Chapters 2 and 3, we look at how the same basic algorithm can be used for both classification and regression. (25:32; 11 pages)
